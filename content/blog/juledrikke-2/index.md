Every year, I brew a Christmas beer to give away to friends and family. This year, I came up with the idea of creating a "chocolate orange" beer, reminiscent of the holiday sweet that my grandma always had on hand. I soon decided that a dark ale with prominent citrus flavor and aroma would be my best bet. I considered brewing a stout or porter, but ultimately settled on a Cascadian Dark Ale (aka Black IPA).

In keeping with the beer style, I incorporated a small amount of dark malts into the recipe for some roastiness and I added a bit of lactose to make the beer smoother and sweeter. (I anticipated that some people would find the typically dry and bitter character of a CDA off-putting.) I also decided to forego the chocolate flavor and primarily focus on the hops.

I purchased a number of hops in bulk from [Puterbaugh Farms](https://hopsdirect.com/) in Washington, including some recently harvested Amarillo and Idaho #7 hops. I experimented with adding smaller amounts of hops in stages toward the end of the boil, and since I had a large quantity of hops, I opted to dry-hop, as well.

I was really pleased with how the beer turned out. More than a few people told me that they enjoyed it even though they don't typically like IPAs.
