Greetings,

I'm Gunnar, the brewer behind Mental Brewing, and I'd like to welcome you to my blog. I built this site so that I could share my brewing knowledge, thoughts on beer-related topics, and (mostly) original homebrew recipes. It's my hope to provide interesting content for brewers of all experience levels.

Cheers!
