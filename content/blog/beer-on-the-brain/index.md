**Greetings!**

I'm Gunnar, the brewer behind Mental Brewing, and this is my inaugural blog post. I built this site so that I could share my brewing experiences, thoughts on brewing topics, and (mostly) original beer recipes. It's my hope to provide something of interest for every level of brewer.

Feel free to [shoot me an email](gunnarmjohnson@gmail.com) if you ever want to chat.

Cheers!
