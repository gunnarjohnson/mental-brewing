## The Brew
This Wee Heavy is my first brew of the 2019-2020 season (I generally don't brew in the summer) and the second iteration of a beer that I brewed last fall. 

My brother Ian is a big fan of Wee Heavies (aka Scotch Ales), so for his birthday last year, I offered to split a batch with him. My one condition was that he assist me on the brew day. He was a great sport - he helped out with the heavy lifting _and_ listened attentively to my commentary on the brewing process. We ended up enjoying the final product so much that we decided to brew the beer again for his birthday this year.

This time around, I got to try out some new equipment, including my shiny, new stainless counterflow chiller (which you can read about in my last post). The brew went very smoothly and the OG was well within the normal range for this beer style. Assuming that the beer turns out as good as last time, I'll be entering it in at least a couple competitions.
