Given that many of these beers were brewed on a ~50 BBL brewhouse, the amount of beer that I've brewed is somewhere in the vicinity of tens of thousands of gallons. This amount is equivalent to millions of pints, or more beer than I could drink in a hundred lifetimes! Thankfully, other people drank the beer for me.
