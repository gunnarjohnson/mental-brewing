This beer is my take on a traditional ESB (Extra Special Bitter). Since I was attempting to brew to style, I used as many authentic UK ingredients as possible. A nice, balanced British pale ale is hard to beat!

**Update**: This beer won a silver medal in the British Beer category of the Redcoat Challenge 2019 homebrew competition.
